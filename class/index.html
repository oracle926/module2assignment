		<p>Loneliness, Stephan. That's why you and I memorialize our dead. There's the briefest of moments before we kill, where we literally hold their life in our hands, and then rip it away, and we're left with nothing. So gathering other people's letters or writing their names on a wall, is a reminder that in the end we're left infinitely and utterly alone</p>

		<p> Over the course of my long life, I have come to believe we are bound forever to those with whom we share blood. And while we may not choose our family, that bond can be our greatest strength or our deepest regret. This unfortunate truth has haunted me for as long as I can recall.</p>

		<p>Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try it again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb. They refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.</p>
